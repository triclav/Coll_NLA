Result: 12 users with over 10 requests with repsonse times over 60 seconds.
This is assuming 1 user = 1 IP address, response time being talked about is upstream response time.

Command:
To generate the actual number:
awk 'BEGIN{FS="\""} $2 ~/^GET \/newspaper\/article/ && $8 > 60 {print $1}' access_log.01-Sep-2019.log 
	| awk '{print $1}' 
	| sort 
	| uniq -c 
	| awk '$1 > 10 {count++} END {print count}'


To generate slightly more detailed information about this:
awk 'BEGIN{FS="\""} $2 ~/^GET \/newspaper\/article/ && $8 > 60 {print $1}' access_log.01-Sep-2019.log 
	| awk '{print $1}' 
	| sort 
	| uniq -c 
	| awk '$1 > 10 {print $0}'


What this means:
The result of the second command above is:
     25 117.92.193.51
     36 117.92.214.40
     38 117.92.23.90
     13 117.92.2.70
     12 165.218.200.33
     36 165.218.64.114
     12 193.233.176.34
     20 217.144.228.110
     14 22.114.11.114
     12 252.254.99.193
     15 252.44.108.140
     12 80.110.187.122


Many of these are in the B class addresses 117.90/16 and 165.218/16. These are in China and in the US respectively. The response time may be caused by latency issues and could be resolved through a mirror site in these locations or a Content Delivery Network such as AWS CloudFront with end points in these areas. In the case of China it is possible that government firewalls are causing the response times and so a mirror or CDN endpoint may prove successful (the slow response time would occur in updating the content, which for newspaper articles would not be dramatic). However, since they are newspaper articles, it may be difficult to establish a mirror site within the Chinese network.
